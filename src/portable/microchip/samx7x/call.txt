Datasheet:

- Before enabling the USB clock in the Power Management Controller, the USBHS must be enabled (by
writing a one to the USBHS_CTRL.USBE bit and a zero to the USBHS_CTRL.FRZCLK bit).

- In Low-power mode:
    select either the PLLA or the UPLL (previously set to ON), and program the PMC_USB register
    (source selection and divider).
    Enable the USBHS peripheral clock (PMC_PCER).
    Put the USBHS in Low-power mode (SPDCONF = 1).
    Enable the USBHS (UIMOD, USBE = 1, FRZCLK = 0).
    Enable the USBCK bit (PMC_SCER).
